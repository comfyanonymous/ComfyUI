        Before submitting a **Bug Report**, please ensure the following:

        - **1:** You are running the latest version of ComfyUI.
        - **2:** You have looked at the existing bug reports and made sure this isn't already reported.
        - **3:** You confirmed that the bug is not caused by a custom node. You can disable all custom nodes by passing
        `--disable-all-custom-nodes` command line argument.
        - **4:** This is an actual bug in ComfyUI, not just a support question. A bug is when you can specify exact
        steps to replicate what went wrong and others will be able to repeat your steps and see the same issue happen.

        If unsure, ask on the [ComfyUI Matrix Space](https://app.element.io/#/room/%23comfyui_space%3Amatrix.org) or the [Comfy Org Discord](https://discord.gg/comfyorg) first.

      description: "Describe how to reproduce the issue. Please be sure to attach a workflow JSON or PNG, ideally one that doesn't require custom nodes to test. If the bug open happens when certain custom nodes are used, most likely that custom node is what has the bug rather than ComfyUI, in which case it should be reported to the node's author."
