# This is a temporary action during frontend TS migration.
# This file should be removed after TS migration is completed.
# The browser test is here to ensure TS repo is working the same way as the
# current JS code.
# If you are adding UI feature, please sync your changes to the TS repo:
# huchenlei/ComfyUI_frontend and update test expectation files accordingly.
