# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important Instructions

**ALWAYS commit changes to git after completing any task.** After making any code changes, modifications, or additions, run:
```bash
# If not in a git repository, initialize it first:
git init

# Then commit changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

## Development Workflow

Repository-specific build, test, and lint commands will be added here as needed.
