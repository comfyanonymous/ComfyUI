1. GUNUNG LEDANG

2. PUTERI GUNUNG LEDANG

4. OLD WOMAN IN THE FOREST  
A hunched old Malay woman walks through the deep rainforest, dressed in faded batik and carrying a cane. Her calm, wise presence hints at a deeper connection to the Puteri—perhaps a messenger, or the Puteri in disguise, testing those who seek her.

5. THE GOLDEN BOWL OF BLOOD  
A golden bowl filled with dark red blood lies untouched on the forest floor. This is one of the seven impossible conditions set by the Puteri—a demand so cruel, it forces the Sultan to question his desires and intentions.

6. THE SULTAN’S SILENCE  
Unable to fulfill the final demands, the Sultan retreats into silence. His pride wounded, his longing unmet, he stands beneath the shadow of Gunung Ledang, realizing that some things are not meant to be conquered.

7. THE PRINCESS RETURNS TO MIST  
As dawn breaks, the Puteri vanishes into the morning mist of the mountain. No war, no union—just peace. Her legend lives on in the hearts of those who dare to dream, but she remains forever beyond reach.
