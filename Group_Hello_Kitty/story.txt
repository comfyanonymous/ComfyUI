1. In the glowing forest at sunrise, a noble Malay princess stands alone, untouched by time or war. Her eyes, calm and resolute, carry the silence of the mountains.

2. Far away, the Sultan’s grand wooden palace rises above the treetops. A symbol of power and desire, it waits for news from his royal emissary.

3. Deep in the jungle, the emissary meets an old woman whose words seem like riddles. She tests his patience, weighing his intentions and soul.

4. In the heart of the forest, a golden bowl filled with royal blood rests upon the grass — a symbol of sacrifice, fate, and the weight of promises made.
