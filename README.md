# Doodle-to-Image Generation with Diffusion Models

This repository contains the implementation of a sketch-to-image generation pipeline developed as part of a Junior Independent Study project at The College of Wooster. The system uses Stable Cascade, ComfyUI, and ControlNet to convert rough user sketches into detailed, high-quality images through diffusion models.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to enable interactive image generation based on simple line drawings. By integrating edge detection (via Canny), prompt conditioning, and latent diffusion techniques, the model allows users to guide both the structure and style of the generated image.

## Features

- Sketch-to-image synthesis using a multi-stage diffusion pipeline
- Canny edge-based conditioning via ControlNet
- Modular, node-based workflow using ComfyUI
- Prompt encoding with CLIP
- Evaluation through SSIM and FID metrics
- Supports training and inference with pretrained models (Stable Cascade)
