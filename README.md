## Release Process

ComfyUI follows a weekly release cycle targeting Monday but this regularly changes because of model releases or large changes to the codebase. There are three interconnected repositories:

1. **[ComfyUI Core](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**
   - Releases a new stable version (e.g., v0.7.0) roughly every week.
   - Commits outside of the stable release tags may be very unstable and break many custom nodes.
   - Serves as the foundation for the desktop release

2. **[ComfyUI Desktop](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop)**
   - Builds a new release using the latest stable core version

3. **[ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend)**
   - Weekly frontend updates are merged into the core repository
   - Features are frozen for the upcoming core release
   - Development continues for the next release cycle

# Installing

## Windows Portable

There is a portable standalone build for Windows that should work for running on Nvidia GPUs or for running on your CPU only on the [releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases).

### [Direct link to download](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)

Simply download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) and run. Make sure you put your Stable Diffusion checkpoints/models (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: ComfyUI\models\checkpoints

If you have trouble extracting it, right click the file -> properties -> unblock

Update your Nvidia drivers if it doesn't start.

#### Alternative Downloads:

[Experimental portable for AMD GPUs](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_amd.7z)

[Portable with pytorch cuda 12.8 and python 3.12](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu128.7z) (Supports Nvidia 10 series and older GPUs).

#### How do I share models between another UI and ComfyUI?

See the [Config file](extra_model_paths.yaml.example) to set the search paths for models. In the standalone windows build you can find this file in the ComfyUI directory. Rename this file to extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.


## [comfy-cli](https://docs.comfy.org/comfy-cli/getting-started)

You can install and start ComfyUI using comfy-cli:
```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy install
```

## Manual Install (Windows, Linux)

Python 3.14 will work if you comment out the `kornia` dependency in the requirements.txt file (breaks the canny node) but it is not recommended.

Python 3.13 is very well supported. If you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13 you can try 3.12

### Instructions:

Git clone this repo.

Put your SD checkpoints (the huge ckpt/safetensors files) in: models/checkpoints

Put your VAE in: models/vae


### AMD GPUs (Linux)

AMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don't have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4```

This is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 7.0 which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.0```


### AMD GPUs (Experimental: Windows and Linux), RDNA 3, 3.5 and 4 only.

These have less hardware support than the builds above but they work on windows. You also need to install the pytorch version specific to your hardware.

RDNA 3 (RX 7000 series):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx110X-dgpu/```

RDNA 3.5 (Strix halo/Ryzen AI Max+ 365):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/```

RDNA 4 (RX 9000 series):

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx120X-all/```

### Intel GPUs (Windows and Linux)

(Option 1) Intel Arc GPU users can install native PyTorch with torch.xpu support using pip. More information can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html)

1. To install PyTorch xpu, use the following command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu```

This is the command to install the Pytorch xpu nightly which might have some performance improvements:

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/xpu```

(Option 2) Alternatively, Intel GPUs supported by Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) can leverage IPEX for improved performance.

1. visit [Installation](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/index.html#installation?platform=gpu) for more information.

### NVIDIA

Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:

```pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130```

This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements.

```pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" error, uninstall torch with:

```pip uninstall torch```

And install it again with the command above.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies by opening your terminal inside the ComfyUI folder and:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After this you should have everything installed and can proceed to running ComfyUI.

### Others:

#### Apple Mac silicon

You can install ComfyUI in Apple Mac silicon (M1 or M2) with any recent macOS version.

1. Install pytorch nightly. For instructions, read the [Accelerated PyTorch training on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) Apple Developer guide (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly).
1. Follow the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) instructions for Windows and Linux.
1. Install the ComfyUI [dependencies](#dependencies). If you have another Stable Diffusion UI [you might be able to reuse the dependencies](#i-already-have-another-ui-for-stable-diffusion-installed-do-i-really-have-to-install-all-of-these-dependencies).
1. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

> **Note**: Remember to add your models, VAE, LoRAs etc. to the corresponding Comfy folders, as discussed in [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux).

#### Ascend NPUs

2. Proceed with the installation of Ascend Basekit, which includes the driver, firmware, and CANN, following the instructions provided for your specific platform.
3. Next, install the necessary packages for torch-npu by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/pytorch/install.html#pytorch) page.
4. Finally, adhere to the [ComfyUI manual installation](#manual-install-windows-linux) guide for Linux. Once all components are installed, you can run ComfyUI as described earlier.

#### Cambricon MLUs

For models compatible with Cambricon Extension for PyTorch (torch_mlu). Here's a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:

1. Install the Cambricon CNToolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cntoolkit_3.7.2/cntoolkit_install_3.7.2/index.html)
2. Next, install the PyTorch(torch_mlu) following the instructions on the [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cambricon_pytorch_1.17.0/user_guide_1.9/index.html)
3. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

#### Iluvatar Corex

For models compatible with Iluvatar Extension for PyTorch. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored to your platform and installation method:

1. Install the Iluvatar Corex Toolkit by adhering to the platform-specific instructions on the [Installation](https://support.iluvatar.com/#/DocumentCentre?id=1&nameCenter=2&productId=520117912052801536)
2. Launch ComfyUI by running `python main.py`

# Running

```python main.py```

### For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm

Try running it with this command if you have issues:

For 6700, 6600 and maybe other RDNA2 or older: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py```

For AMD 7600 and maybe other RDNA3 cards: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 python main.py```

### AMD ROCm Tips

You can enable experimental memory efficient attention on recent pytorch in ComfyUI on some AMD GPUs using this command, it should already be enabled by default on RDNA3. If this improves speed for you on latest pytorch on your GPU please report it so that I can enable it by default.

```TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 python main.py --use-pytorch-cross-attention```

You can also try setting this env variable `PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1` which might speed things up at the cost of a very slow initial run.

# Notes

Only parts of the graph that have an output with all the correct inputs will be executed.

Only parts of the graph that change from each execution to the next will be executed, if you submit the same graph twice only the first will be executed. If you change the last part of the graph only the part you changed and the part that depends on it will be executed.

Dragging a generated png on the webpage or loading one will give you the full workflow including seeds that were used to create it.

You can use () to change emphasis of a word or phrase like: (good code:1.2) or (bad code:0.8). The default emphasis for () is 1.1. To use () characters in your actual prompt escape them like \\( or \\).

You can use {day|night}, for wildcard/dynamic prompts. With this syntax "{wild|card|test}" will be randomly replaced by either "wild", "card" or "test" by the frontend every time you queue the prompt. To use {} characters in your actual prompt escape them like: \\{ or \\}.

Dynamic prompts also support C-style comments, like `// comment` or `/* comment */`.

To use a textual inversion concepts/embeddings in a text prompt put them in the models/embeddings directory and use them in the CLIPTextEncode node like this (you can omit the .pt extension):

```embedding:embedding_filename.pt```


## How to show high-quality previews?

Use ```--preview-method auto``` to enable previews.

The default installation includes a fast latent preview method that's low-resolution. To enable higher-quality previews with [TAESD](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd), download the [taesd_decoder.pth, taesdxl_decoder.pth, taesd3_decoder.pth and taef1_decoder.pth](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd/) and place them in the `models/vae_approx` folder. Once they're installed, restart ComfyUI and launch it with `--preview-method taesd` to enable high-quality previews.

## How to use TLS/SSL?
Generate a self-signed certificate (not appropriate for shared/production use) and key by running the command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname"`

Use `--tls-keyfile key.pem --tls-certfile cert.pem` to enable TLS/SSL, the app will now be accessible with `https://...` instead of `http://...`.

> Note: Windows users can use [alexisrolland/docker-openssl](https://github.com/alexisrolland/docker-openssl) or one of the [3rd party binary distributions](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) to run the command example above.
<br/><br/>If you use a container, note that the volume mount `-v` can be a relative path so `... -v ".\:/openssl-certs" ...` would create the key & cert files in the current directory of your command prompt or powershell terminal.

## Frontend Development

As of August 15, 2024, we have transitioned to a new frontend, which is now hosted in a separate repository: [ComfyUI Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This repository now hosts the compiled JS (from TS/Vue) under the `web/` directory.

### Reporting Issues and Requesting Features

For any bugs, issues, or feature requests related to the frontend, please use the [ComfyUI Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend). This will help us manage and address frontend-specific concerns more efficiently.

### Using the Latest Frontend

The new frontend is now the default for ComfyUI. However, please note:

1. The frontend in the main ComfyUI repository is updated fortnightly.
2. Daily releases are available in the separate frontend repository.

To use the most up-to-date frontend version:

1. For the latest daily release, launch ComfyUI with this command line argument:

   ```
   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@latest
   ```

2. For a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version number:

   ```
   --front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend@1.2.2
   ```

This approach allows you to easily switch between the stable fortnightly release and the cutting-edge daily updates, or even specific versions for testing purposes.

### Accessing the Legacy Frontend

If you need to use the legacy frontend for any reason, you can access it using the following command line argument:

```
--front-end-version Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend@latest
```

This will use a snapshot of the legacy frontend preserved in the [ComfyUI Legacy Frontend repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_legacy_frontend).
