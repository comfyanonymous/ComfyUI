Project Title: Realistic Character Animation Workflow ‚Äì BADANG

üìù Introduction

This project focuses on developing a realistic character animation workflow centered around Badang, a legendary warrior from Malay folklore. By utilizing industry-standard tools such as Blender, Maya, or Unreal Engine, the goal is to create highly detailed, lifelike animations that bring the character to life through expressive movements and realistic body mechanics.

The project combines advanced technical animation techniques with cultural storytelling, offering a modern visual representation of traditional Southeast Asian mythology.

üìö Background of Badang

Badang is a well-known legendary figure in Malay folklore, celebrated for his superhuman strength. As the story goes, Badang was once a servant who gained immense power after helping a mystical creature by a river. With his new strength, he rose to become a warrior and eventually served as a royal champion in the Sri Vijaya empire.

The character of Badang is chosen for this project due to his mythical appeal, rich cultural value, and action-driven nature, which are ideal for exploring dynamic and realistic animation in a modern digital context.
