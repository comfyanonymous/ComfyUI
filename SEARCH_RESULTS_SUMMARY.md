### Compliance with Wiki Requirements

According to the [How to Contribute Code](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/wiki/How-to-Contribute-Code) wiki:

**Recommendation**: 
- This PR addresses well-documented user pain points (missing dependencies, CPU-only PyTorch)
- The improvements are clearly beneficial and non-controversial
