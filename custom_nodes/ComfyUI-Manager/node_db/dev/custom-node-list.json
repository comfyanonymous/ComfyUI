Its core idea involves simulating diffusion processes by iteratively adding noise and using neural networks to predict and remove the noise, thereby generating high-quality images. This approach is not limited to image generation; with appropriate network architecture and training data, it can be adapted for various other tasks. The application of neural networks extends beyond image generation. By adjusting network structures and loss functions, neural networks can also perform tasks such as classification and regression. This flexibility makes neural networks a powerful tool for handling a wide range of machine learning tasks. This project aims to expand custom neural network layers (such as linear layers, convolutional layers, etc.) within ComfyUI and provide simplified task training functionalities. Through this project, users can easily construct custom neural network layers and perform training in ComfyUI using a graphical interface."
