**ComfyUI-Easy-Use** is an efficiency custom nodes integration package, which is extended on the basis of [TinyTerraNodes](https://github.com/TinyTerra/ComfyUI_tinyterraNodes). It has been integrated and optimized for many popular awesome custom nodes to achieve the purpose of faster and more convenient use of ComfyUI. While ensuring the degree of freedom, it restores the ultimate smooth image production experience that belongs to Stable Diffusion.

## 👨🏻‍🎨 Introduce

- Inspire by [tinyterraNodes](https://github.com/TinyTerra/ComfyUI_tinyterraNodes), which greatly reduces the time cost of tossing workflows。
- UI interface beautification, the first time you install the user, if you need to use the UI theme, please switch the theme in Settings -> Color Palette and refresh page.
- Added a node for pre-sampling parameter configuration, which can be separated from the sampling node for easier previewing
- Wildcards and lora's are supported, for Lora Block Weight usage, ensure that the custom node package has the [ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack)
- Multi-selectable styled cue word selector, default is Fooocus style json, custom json can be placed under styles, samples folder can be placed in the preview image (name and name consistent, image file name such as spaces need to be converted to underscores '_')
- The loader enables the A1111 prompt mode, which reproduces nearly identical images to those generated by webui, and needs to be installed [ComfyUI_smZNodes](https://github.com/shiimizu/ComfyUI_smZNodes) first. 
- Noise injection into the latent space can be achieved using the `easy latentNoisy` or `easy preSamplingNoiseIn` node
- Simplified processes for SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL, SVD, Zero123, etc. [Example](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use?tab=readme-ov-file#StableDiffusion)
- Simplified Stable Cascade [Example](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use?tab=readme-ov-file#StableCascade)
- Simplified Layer Diffuse [Example](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use?tab=readme-ov-file#LayerDiffusion)，The first time you use it you may need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
- Simplified InstantID [Example](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use?tab=readme-ov-file#InstantID), You need to make sure that the custom node package has the [ComfyUI_InstantID](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_InstantID)
- Extending the usability of XYplot
- Fooocus Inpaint integration
- Integration of common logical calculations, conversion of types, display of all types, etc.
- Background removal nodes for the RMBG-1.4 model supporting BriaAI, [BriaAI Guide](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4)
- Forcibly cleared the memory usage of the comfy UI model are supported
- Stable Diffusion 3 multi-account API nodes are supported
- Support SD3's model
- Support Kolors‘s model
- Support Flux's model
- Support lazy if else and for loops
