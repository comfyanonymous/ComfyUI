You can download ReSwapper models here:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/tree/main/models
Just put them into the "models/reswapper" directory.

- NSFW-detector to not violate [GitHub rules](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-misinformation-and-disinformation#synthetic--manipulated-media-tools)
- New node "Unload ReActor Models" - is useful for complex WFs when you need to free some VRAM utilized by ReActor

</center>

- Fixes and improvements


### 0.5.1

- Support of GPEN 1024/2048 restoration models (available in the HF dataset https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/tree/main/models/facerestore_models)
- ReActorFaceBoost Node - an attempt to improve the quality of swapped faces. The idea is to restore and scale the swapped face (according to the `face_size` parameter of the restoration model) BEFORE pasting it to the target image (via inswapper algorithms), more information is [here (PR#321)](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/pull/321)

[Full size demo preview](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.1-whatsnew-02.png)

- Sorting facemodels alphabetically
- A lot of fixes and improvements

### [0.5.0 <sub><sup>BETA4</sup></sub>](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

- Spandrel lib support for GFPGAN

### 0.5.0 <sub><sup>BETA3</sup></sub>

- Fixes: "RAM issue", "No detection" for MaskingHelper

### 0.5.0 <sub><sup>BETA2</sup></sub>

- You can now build a blended face model from a batch of face models you already have, just add the "Make Face Model Batch" node to your workflow and connect several models via "Load Face Model"
- Huge performance boost of the image analyzer's module! 10x speed up! Working with videos is now a pleasure!

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-05.png?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-05" width="100%"/>

### 0.5.0 <sub><sup>BETA1</sup></sub>

- SWAPPED_FACE output for the Masking Helper Node
- FIX: Empty A-channel for Masking Helper IMAGE output (causing errors with some nodes) was removed

### 0.5.0 <sub><sup>ALPHA1</sup></sub>

- ReActorBuildFaceModel Node got "face_model" output to provide a blended face model directly to the main Node:

Basic workflow [üíæ](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/workflows/ReActor--Build-Blended-Face-Model--v2.json)

- Face Masking feature is available now, just add the "ReActorMaskHelper" Node to the workflow and connect it as shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-01.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-01" width="100%"/>

If you don't have the "face_yolov8m.pt" Ultralytics model - you can download it from the [Assets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/blob/main/models/detection/bbox/face_yolov8m.pt) and put it into the "ComfyUI\models\ultralytics\bbox" directory
<br>
As well as ["sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth"](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/blob/main/models/sams/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth) model - download (if you don't have it) and put it into the "ComfyUI\models\sams" directory;

Use this Node to gain the best results of the face swapping process:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-02.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-02" width="100%"/>

- ReActorImageDublicator Node - rather useful for those who create videos, it helps to duplicate one image to several frames to use them with VAE Encoder (e.g. live avatars):

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-03.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-03" width="100%"/>

- ReActorFaceSwapOpt (a simplified version of the Main Node) + ReActorOptions Nodes to set some additional options such as (new) "input/source faces separate order". Yes! You can now set the order of faces in the index in the way you want ("large to small" goes by default)!

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-04.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-04" width="100%"/>

- Little speed boost when analyzing target images (unfortunately it is still quite slow in compare to swapping and restoring...)

### [0.4.2](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/releases/tag/v0.4.2)

- GPEN-BFR-512 and RestoreFormer_Plus_Plus face restoration models support

You can download models here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/tree/main/models/facerestore_models
<br>Put them into the `ComfyUI\models\facerestore_models` folder

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.4.2-whatsnew-04.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.4.2-whatsnew-04" width="100%"/>

- Due to popular demand - you can now blend several images with persons into one face model file and use it with "Load Face Model" Node or in SD WebUI as well;

Experiment and create new faces or blend faces of one person to gain better accuracy and likeness!

Just add the ImpactPack's "Make Image Batch" Node as the input to the ReActor's one and load images you want to blend into one model:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.4.2-whatsnew-01.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.4.2-whatsnew-01" width="100%"/>

Result example (the new face was created from 4 faces of different actresses):

Basic workflow [üíæ](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/workflows/ReActor--Build-Blended-Face-Model--v1.json)

### [0.4.1](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/releases/tag/v0.4.1)

- CUDA 12 Support - don't forget to run (Windows) `install.bat` or (Linux/MacOS) `install.py` for ComfyUI's Python enclosure or try to install ORT-GPU for CU12 manually (https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/install/#install-onnx-runtime-gpu-cuda-12x)
- Issue https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/issues/173 fix

- Separate Node for the Face Restoration postprocessing (FR https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/issues/191), can be found inside ReActor's menu (RestoreFace Node)
- (Windows) Installation can be done for Python from the System's PATH
- Different fixes and improvements

- Face Restore Visibility and CodeFormer Weight (Fidelity) options are now available! Don't forget to reload the Node in your existing workflow

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.4.1-whatsnew-01.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.4.1-whatsnew-01" width="100%"/>

### [0.4.0](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

- Input "input_image" goes first now, it gives a correct bypass and also it is right to have the main input first;
- You can now save face models as "safetensors" files (`ComfyUI\models\reactor\faces`) and load them into ReActor implementing different scenarios and keeping super lightweight face models of the faces you use:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.4.0-whatsnew-01.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.4.0-whatsnew-01" width="100%"/>

- Ability to build and save face models directly from an image:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.4.0-whatsnew-03.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.4.0-whatsnew-03" width="50%"/>

- Both the inputs are optional, just connect one of them according to your workflow; if both is connected - `image` has a priority.
- Different fixes making this extension better.

Thanks to everyone who finds bugs, suggests new features and supports this project!

  - ReActorUnload (Unload ReActor models from VRAM)

Connect all required slots and run the query.

### Main Node Inputs

- `input_image` - is an image to be processed (target image, analog of "target image" in the SD WebUI extension);
  - Supported Nodes: "Load Image", "Load Video" or any other nodes providing images as an output;
- `source_image` - is an image with a face or faces to swap in the `input_image` (source image, analog of "source image" in the SD WebUI extension);
  - Supported Nodes: "Load Image" or any other nodes providing images as an output;
- `face_model` - is the input for the "Load Face Model" Node or another ReActor node to provide a face model file (face embedding) you created earlier via the "Save Face Model" Node;
  - Supported Nodes: "Load Face Model", "Build Blended Face Model";
- `options` - to connect ReActorOptions;
  - Supported Nodes: "ReActorOptions";
- `face_boost` - to connect ReActorFaceBoost;
  - Supported Nodes: "ReActorFaceBoost";

### Main Node Outputs

- `IMAGE` - is an output with the resulted image;
  - Supported Nodes: any nodes which have images as an input;
- `FACE_MODEL` - is an output providing a source face's model being built during the swapping process;
  - Supported Nodes: "Save Face Model", "ReActor", "Make Face Model Batch";
- `ORIGINAL_IMAGE` - `input_image` bypass;

### Face Restoration

Since version 0.3.0 ReActor Node has a buil-in face restoration.<br>Just download the models you want (see [Installation](#installation) instruction) and select one of them to restore the resulting face(s) during the faceswap. It will enhance face details and make your result more accurate.

### Face Indexes

By default ReActor detects faces in images from "large" to "small".<br>You can change this option by adding ReActorFaceSwapOpt node with ReActorOptions.

And if you need to specify faces, you can set indexes for source and input images.

Index of the first detected face is 0.

You can set indexes in the order you need.<br>
E.g.: 0,1,2 (for Source); 1,0,2 (for Input).<br>This means: the second Input face (index = 1) will be swapped by the first Source face (index = 0) and so on.

### Genders

You can specify the gender to detect in images.<br>
ReActor will swap a face only if it meets the given condition.

### Face Models

Since version 0.4.0 you can save face models as "safetensors" files (stored in `ComfyUI\models\reactor\faces`) and load them into ReActor implementing different scenarios and keeping super lightweight face models of the faces you use.

To make new models appear in the list of the "Load Face Model" Node - just refresh the page of your ComfyUI web application.<br>
(I recommend you to use ComfyUI Manager - otherwise you workflow can be lost after you refresh the page if you didn't save it before that).

### Masking Helper

Face Masking feature is available since version 0.5.0, just add the "ReActorMaskHelper" Node to the workflow and connect it as shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-01.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-01" width="100%"/>

If you don't have the "face_yolov8m.pt" Ultralytics model - you can download it from the [Assets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/blob/main/models/detection/bbox/face_yolov8m.pt) and put it into the "ComfyUI\models\ultralytics\bbox" directory
<br>
As well as ["sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth"](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/blob/main/models/sams/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth) or ["sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth"](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/blob/main/models/sams/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth) (better occlusion) - download (if you don't have it) and put it into the "ComfyUI\models\sams" directory;

Use this Node to gain the best results of the face swapping process:

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.5.0-whatsnew-02.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.5.0-whatsnew-02" width="100%"/>

### Face Swap Weigth

You can set the strength of face swap for `source_image` or `face_model` from 0% to 100% (in 12.5% step) with `ReActorSetWeight` node

<center>
<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/0.6.0-whatsnew-01.jpg?raw=true" alt="0.6.0-whatsnew-01" width="100%"/>
</center>

## Troubleshooting

<a name="insightfacebuild">

### **I. (For Windows users) If you still cannot build Insightface for some reasons or just don't want to install Visual Studio or VS C++ Build Tools - do the following:**

1. (ComfyUI Portable) From the root folder check the version of Python:<br>run CMD and type `python_embeded\python.exe -V`
2. Download prebuilt Insightface package [for Python 3.10](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/Insightface/insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl) or [for Python 3.11](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/Insightface/insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl) (if in the previous step you see 3.11) or [for Python 3.12](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/Insightface/insightface-0.7.3-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl) (if in the previous step you see 3.12) and put into the stable-diffusion-webui (A1111 or SD.Next) root folder (where you have "webui-user.bat" file) or into ComfyUI root folder if you use ComfyUI Portable
3. From the root folder run:
   - (SD WebUI) CMD and `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - (ComfyUI Portable) run CMD
4. Then update your PIP:
   - (SD WebUI) `python -m pip install -U pip`
   - (ComfyUI Portable) `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -U pip`
5. Then install Insightface:
   - (SD WebUI) `pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl` (for 3.10) or `pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl` (for 3.11) or `pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl` (for 3.12)
   - (ComfyUI Portable) `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl` (for 3.10) or `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl` (for 3.11) or `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl` (for 3.12)
6. Enjoy!

### **II. "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'"**

This error may occur if there's smth wrong with the model file `inswapper_128.onnx`

Try to download it manually from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/resolve/main/models/inswapper_128.onnx)
and put it to the `ComfyUI\models\insightface` replacing existing one

### **III. "reactor.execute() got an unexpected keyword argument 'reference_image'"**

This means that input points have been changed with the latest update<br>
Remove the current ReActor Node from your workflow and add it again

### **IV. ControlNet Aux Node IMPORT failed error when using with ReActor Node**

1. Close ComfyUI if it runs
2. Go to the ComfyUI root folder, open CMD there and run:
   - `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip uninstall -y opencv-python opencv-contrib-python opencv-python-headless`
   - `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install opencv-python==4.7.0.72`
3. That's it!

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/blob/main/comfyui-reactor-node/uploads/reactor-w-controlnet.png?raw=true" alt="reactor+controlnet" />

### **V. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'basicsr'" or "subprocess-exited-with-error" during future-0.18.3 installation**

- Download https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/comfyui-reactor-node/future-0.18.3-py3-none-any.whl<br>
- Put it to ComfyUI root And run:

      python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install future-0.18.3-py3-none-any.whl

- Then:

      python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install basicsr

### **VI. "fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output" when you try to `git clone` the repository"**

Try to clone with `--depth=1` (last commit only):

     git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Gourieff/ComfyUI-ReActor

Then retrieve the rest (if you need):

     git fetch --unshallow

## Updating

Just put .bat or .sh script from this [Repo](https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-extensions-updater) to the `ComfyUI\custom_nodes` directory and run it when you need to check for updates

### Note!

**If you encounter any errors when you use ReActor Node - don't rush to open an issue, first try to remove current ReActor node in your workflow and add it again**

**ReActor Node gets updates from time to time, new functions appear and old node can work with errors or not work at all**
