# Architecture and Interfaces

Detailed rules referenced from [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

## Architecture Boundaries

- Keep each layer focused on the concepts it owns. Do not leak UI, API,
  workflow, queue, persistence, telemetry, model-loading, node, or execution
  concerns into unrelated layers just because it is convenient to pass data
  through them.
- Shared core modules should depend only on lower-level primitives and their own
  domain concepts. Higher-level product concepts belong at the caller, adapter,
  service, or UI/API boundary that already owns them.
- Pass the narrowest data needed across a boundary. Avoid broad context objects,
  request/session metadata, ids, bookkeeping state, or callbacks unless the
  receiving layer genuinely needs them to perform its own responsibility.
- Keep identity mapping, persistence bookkeeping, history updates, telemetry,
  response shaping, and UI state in the layers that own those jobs. Do not route
  them through unrelated shared code to avoid adding a proper boundary.
- Treat `execution.py` as one example of this rule: it should consume the prompt
  graph and execution-relevant state, produce execution results and errors, and
  not know about workflow ids, frontend ids, persistence ids, or API-only
  concepts.
- Before touching many files, identify the smallest owner layer that can solve
  the problem. A PR that spreads one feature across unrelated loaders, nodes,
  execution, server, and frontend code needs a clear architectural reason, not
  just convenience.
- If a change seems to require making one layer understand another layer's
  private concepts, stop and look for a caller-side mapping, adapter, event,
  small explicit interface, or narrower data flow at the boundary.

## State Ownership

- Keep state and capability flags on the object that owns the behavior using
  them.
- Avoid probing child objects with `getattr(child, "...", default)` to decide
  parent-level control flow. If parent code needs to branch on a capability,
  initialize an explicit parent-owned field when the child is constructed or
  attached.
- Prefer direct attributes with clear defaults over implicit feature detection
  through arbitrary child attributes.
- Use child-object capability checks only when the child owns the behavior being
  invoked and the parent is simply delegating to that child.

## Interface Contracts

- Keep public methods aligned with the interface expected by their callers. Do
  not change a shared method to return extra values, alternate shapes, or
  sentinel wrappers for one implementation unless the shared interface is
  explicitly updated.
- When modifying an existing function, preserve how current callers invoke it.
  Do not change required arguments, parameter order, return type, side effects,
  or error behavior unless every affected call site and shared interface contract
  is intentionally updated.
- Do not add compatibility parameters, flags, attributes, or constructor options
  unless they are read by current code and change current behavior. Remove
  pass-through or stored-but-unused values instead of preserving upstream or
  deprecated API baggage.
- Do not add a model-specific option to a shared helper when only one caller
  needs it. Keep one-off behavior at the model integration boundary, or extend
  the shared helper only when the option is a coherent reusable capability.
- Implementations of shared model interfaces should accept the standard caller
  contract without model-specific rejection branches for optional capabilities
  they do not consume. Let supported behavior be determined by implementation
  paths that actually use those inputs.
- If an implementation needs auxiliary values for its own workflow, expose them
  through a private helper or a clearly named implementation-specific method
  instead of overloading the public method's return contract.
- Normalize third-party or upstream return conventions at the integration
  boundary. Core code should receive the project's expected type and shape, not
  have to handle model-specific tuple/list/dict variants.
- Avoid caller-side unwrapping such as `out = out[0]` unless the called
  interface is documented to return that structure.
