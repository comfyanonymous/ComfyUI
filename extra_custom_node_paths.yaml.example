# Rename this to extra_custom_node_paths.yaml and ComfyUI will load it

# Configuration for custom nodes
# The custom_nodes directory is always called "custom_nodes" and is located under base_path
# Each config section can only have one base_path

# Example configuration using base_path
# This will look for custom_nodes under the specified base_path
comfyui:
      base_path: ../

# Another example with a different path
# other_custom_nodes:
#     base_path: /path/to/base

# You can add more custom node path configurations as needed
# additional_custom_nodes:
#     base_path: another/base/path
